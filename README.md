# SCRAPING MODEL

Examples of situations where it might be advantageous to have a Python program to extract information from spreadsheets or .pdf files in order to consolidate the data into a specific configuration in a final spreadsheet. I created this code as an easy-to-understand example to publish on YouTube, aiming to demonstrate how such a program can simplify and automate the process of handling and organizing data from different sources.
